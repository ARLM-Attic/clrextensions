

Basic Organization:

	To faciliate those who wish to import the library as a whole, there are no per-file namepaces. (This is for VB developers, C# developers will have to import on a per-module basis.)

	Files will be organized in a folder structure mirroring the namespaces they extend.

	Extension methods will be contained in modules names "xxxExtension" where xxx is the class being extended.

	Extensions for arrays will be in the parent class's module.
	
	No module name may start with the interface prefix I. For example, extension methods for IList go in the ListExtension module. Likewise, IDictionary methods go in DictionaryExtension.

	Exension methods that don't take an instance method sill follow the "xxxExtension" pattern. For example, ThreadExtension.Sleep(minutes, seconds) will go there.

Special rule for Strings:
	Methods that extend String, but don't return a string, are not in the StringExtension module. Rather, they are with the returned type. For example, String.ToByteArray(encoding) is with Byte().ToString in ByteExtension.

	This is done because 
		a. the StringExtension class is huge and 
		b. many operations have natural pairs.

	Empty strings should be returned instead of nulls. The exception is methods that accept a string and return the same string.

Parameter Validation:

	All methods should be as permissive as possible, especially with parameters that may be passed in from the user. In general, null strings/collections should be treated as empty strings/collections.
	

Parameter Names:

	Name parameters as if they were normal functions. Don't use "this" for a parameter name.
	
	The names "value" and "source" are good for scalars and collections respectively.
	
Testing:

	Anything that has not been tested should be marked as "Untested" and excluded from "Release" builds using #IF regions
	
Lists and Enumerables:

	Functions that take lists should return lists.
	Functions that take enumerables should return enumerables
	
Namespaces

	Modules of Extension Methods don't go in a namespace
	Other Modules and Classes follow the folder pattern
	Win32 is the root for all P/Invoke features
	Win32/xxx shall have all xxx.dll related features
	Win32/xxxAPI is the module for the P/Invoke stuff itself
